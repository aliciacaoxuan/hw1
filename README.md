I used rmarkdown to create a html and pdf document. I tried my best and add some R code to make the output looks exactly the same as the ouput of the org-mode file, except that mine is a pdf document instead of a beamer. Another differnece is that the plots for project normal and Langevin distributions are not generated from R. I also noted that the html file performs better in image sizing and locating. To obatain a better result in pdf, more configurations should be made.
